# Refine Project Docs

Distil what was learned this session back into `docs/`.

1. Review changes made, decisions taken, problems solved, and patterns discovered this session.
2. Identify which existing doc files to update and what new information belongs where.
3. Draft small, surgical edits — prefer targeted changes over rewrites.
4. **Propose new files or directory-structure changes before creating them; wait for approval.**
5. Apply approved changes and report what was updated, with file paths and a short summary.

### Guidelines

- Concise and scannable: headings, bullet points, short paragraphs.
- Record *why* decisions were made, not just *what* was done.
- Remove wrong or obsolete information.
- Don't duplicate what is clear from the code.
- One topic per file; ask before splitting.
- Write clearly: active voice, positive form, omit needless words, be specific.
