# Quick Checklist

Use this for the first revision pass.

1. Prefer active voice.
2. Prefer positive framing.
3. Use specific, concrete nouns and verbs.
4. Remove filler (`in order to`, `the fact that`, throat-clearing intros).
5. Keep subject, verb, and object close together.
6. Keep parallel items in parallel form.
7. Fix comma splices, run-ons, and accidental fragments.
8. Use the Oxford comma in 3+ item series.
9. Put emphasis at sentence ends.
10. Cut weak intensifiers (`very`, `really`, `quite`) when possible.
11. Replace weak openers (`there is/are`, `one of the most`) with direct claims.
12. If a sentence is still hard to parse, rewrite it instead of patching.

Output:
- Revised text
- 3–6 bullets explaining key edits
