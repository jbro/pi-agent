# Index

Goal: use the smallest useful reference file for editing prose.

Load order:
1. `quick-checklist.min.md` (default first pass)
2. `rules-core.min.md` (structure, punctuation, composition)
3. `misused-words.min.md` (usage and word-choice fixes)

Hard rule:
- Do **not** load `elements-of-style.md` during normal operation.

Token policy:
- Load one extra file at a time, only if needed.
