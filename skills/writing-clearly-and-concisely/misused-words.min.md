# Misused Words and Forms

Prefer these fixes:
- `different than` → `different from`
- `less` (count nouns) → `fewer`
- `like` before clause → `as` (or recast)
- `can` for permission → `may`
- adverbial `due to` → `because of` / `owing to`
- `data is` (formal prose) → `data are`
- `could care less` → `couldn't care less`
- `comprised of` → `composed of` / `comprises`
- `irregardless` → `regardless`
- `utilize` (no special nuance) → `use`
- `in order to` → `to`
- `the fact that` → delete or recast directly
- `there is/are` opener → concrete subject when possible
- hedges `kind of/sort of` → precise qualifier or delete
- `interesting` preamble → remove and make content itself interesting
- unnecessary `respectively` → delete
- `student body` (generic) → `students`
- `worth while` before noun → recast

Also avoid:
- comma splices
- accidental fragments
- repeated `but ... but ...`
- empty noun crutches (`factor`, `feature`, `aspect`, `case`) when concrete wording exists

Edit order:
1. Fix incorrect/nonstandard forms.
2. Remove filler and weak intensifiers.
3. Recast sentences that still sound mechanical.
