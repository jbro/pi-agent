# Writing Clearly and Concisely

Use this skill for docs, READMEs, PR text, commit messages, UI copy, errors, comments, and explanations.

## Load Policy (Token-Critical)

- **NEVER load `elements-of-style.md`** (archival source only; very large).
- Start with `Read `quick-checklist.min.md` in this skill's directory`.
- If you need deeper guidance on sentence structure and style principles, read `rules-core.min.md`.
- If you need usage/word-choice fixes, read `misused-words.min.md`.
- `index.md` is a compact router for which file to load.

## Workflow

1. Draft or inspect text.
2. Apply `quick-checklist.min.md`.
3. Load one deeper min file only if needed.
4. Return concise revision + brief rationale.

Default to the smallest useful context.
