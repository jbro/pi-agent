# Core Rules (R1–R18)

Usage and punctuation:
- R1: Form possessive singular with `'s` (except standard fixed exceptions).
- R2: In a 3+ item series, use commas between items (include Oxford comma).
- R3: Set parenthetic/nonrestrictive elements off with paired commas.
- R4: Use a comma before a coordinating conjunction joining independent clauses.
- R5: If independent clauses are not joined by a conjunction, use `;` or `.` (not comma splice).
- R6: Avoid accidental sentence fragments.
- R7: Introductory participial phrase must refer to the grammatical subject.

Composition:
- R8: One paragraph per topic.
- R9: Start with a topic sentence when useful.
- R10: Prefer active voice.
- R11: Put statements in positive form.
- R12: Use definite, specific, concrete language.
- R13: Omit needless words.
- R14: Avoid strings of loose sentences.
- R15: Express coordinate ideas in similar form.
- R16: Keep related words together.
- R17: Keep tense consistent in summaries.
- R18: Put emphatic words at sentence end.

Heuristics:
- Weak writing: apply R10 → R13 → R12 → R18.
- Unclear writing: apply R16 → R15 → R5/R4.
- Wandering paragraph: apply R8 → R9.
